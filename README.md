> üó£Ô∏è oidc-spa has been introduced at KeyConf 2025, [see replay](https://youtu.be/Z8zIjZx6DK4?si=W1cQN-AOt0pmolql).

A full-featured OpenID Connect / OAuth2 client for single-page applications (SPAs).

With `oidc-spa`, you can seamlessly integrate authentication providers like [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), or [Microsoft Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id) into your application, purely on the client side,
[without involving your backend in the token exchange](https://docs.oidc-spa.dev/resources/why-no-client-secret).

In **simple terms**, `oidc-spa` is a library that makes it easy to **add authentication** to your Vite or Angular project.  
There are many authentication and user management platforms out there: Okta, Auth0, Entra ID...  
There are also plenty of self-hosted options like Keycloak, Ory Hydra, and Dex.  
What all of these have in common is that they implement the OpenID Connect/OAuth2 standard.

This library provides a **unified way** to connect with these different providers instead of having to use
their specific SDKs.

`oidc-spa` implement the [**Authorization Code Flow with PKCE**](https://docs.oidc-spa.dev/resources/why-no-client-secret), this means that **you do not need a backend and a database** to handle the authentication process.  
The authentication process is handled entirely in the browser. And no need for `/login` or `/logout` routes.

## Why `oidc-spa`?

Most OIDC providers push their own client libraries:

-   **Auth0** ‚Üí `auth0-spa-js`
-   **Microsoft Entra ID** ‚Üí `MSAL.js`
-   **Keycloak** ‚Üí `keycloak-js` (no longer actively promoted)
-   **... and so on.**

These libraries are **tied to a specific provider**. But what if you need to:

‚úÖ Switch OIDC providers without modifying your authentication logic?  
‚úÖ Build a self-hostable solution that works with any provider (e.g., you're developing a dashboard app that you sell to enterprises and need to integrate with their existing IAM system)?  
‚úÖ Stop re-learning authentication implementation every time you change providers?

And besides, not all SDKs are equal in terms of setup simplicity, performance, and API quality.

We wanted a **universal solution**, one that is as good or better than all existing SDKs in every aspect.

## Features

-   üéì **No OIDC/OAuth2 expertise required**: Easy to setup and use. We're here to help [on Discord](https://discord.gg/mJdYJSdcm4)!
-   üõ†Ô∏è **Simple setup**: No need to define `/login` or `/logout` routes, token refreshing is automatic, it just works.
-   ‚ú® **React and Angular integration**: Expose a framework agnostic API but also a React adapter `oidc-spa/react` and an Angular adapter `oidc-spa/angular`.
-   üî• **No limitation**- For example, everything you could do with `keycloak-js`, you can do with `oidc-spa`.
-   üí¨ **Detailed debug messages**: If your OIDC server is not properly configured, it tells you precisely what‚Äôs wrong and what you need to do to fix it.
-   üï£ **Auto logout with countdown**: "You will be logged out in 10... 9... 8...", users see exactly when their session expires.
-   üö™ **Logout propagation**: Logging out in one tab logs out all others.
-   üìñ **Comprehensive documentation**: Guides and examples for common scenarios.
-   ‚úÖ **Type safety**: Strong TypeScript support with optional [Zod](https://zod.dev/) integration validating the expected shape of the ID token.
-   üîí **Security-first**: Uses [**Authorization Code Flow + PKCE**](https://docs.oidc-spa.dev/resources/why-no-client-secret#id-2.-authorization-code-flow--pkce-used-by-oidc-spa), No token persistence in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.
-   üñ•Ô∏è **Optional backend utilities**: Provides tools for token validation in JavaScript backends (Node.js, Deno, Web Workers).
-   üç™ **No third-party cookie issues**: Third-party cookies blocked? No problem, `oidc-spa` works around it automatically with no special measures needed on your side.
-   üîó **Multi-instance support**: Run multiple `oidc-spa` instances in the same app without conflict.

## Comparison with Existing Libraries

### [oidc-client-ts](https://github.com/authts/oidc-client-ts)

While `oidc-client-ts` is a comprehensive toolkit designed for various applications that oidc-spa uses under the hood, `oidc-spa` is specifically built for SPAs with an easy-to-set-up API.  
But **ease of use** isn't the only difference, `oidc-spa` also provides **out-of-the-box** solutions for features that `oidc-client-ts` leaves up to you to implement, such as:

-   **Login/logout propagation** across tabs
-   **Graceful fallback when third-party cookies are blocked**
-   **Seamless browser back/forward cache (bfcache) management**
-   **Auto logout countdown** so users can be automatically logged out after a set period of inactivity.
-   **Ensuring you never get an expired access token error**, even after the computer wakes up from sleep.
-   **Gracefully handles scenarios where the provider does not issue a refresh token or lacks a logout endpoint** (e.g., Google OAuth)

### [react-oidc-context](https://github.com/authts/react-oidc-context)

`react-oidc-context` is a React wrapper around `oidc-client-ts`.  
`oidc-spa` also feature a carefully crafted React API that comes with [working examples that you can test locally](https://docs.oidc-spa.dev/example-setups/example-setups).

### [keycloak-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keycloak-js)

The official OIDC Client for Keycloak. It only works with Keycloak and [will eventually be deprecated](https://www.keycloak.org/2023/03/adapter-deprecation-update).  
Beyond that, achieving the same seamless user experience as `oidc-spa` with `keycloak-js` requires writing a lot of custom code, code that really **shouldn‚Äôt** be handled at the application level.

### [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)

Since oidc-spa is built for true SPAs, Next.js applications should use NextAuth.js instead.

## We built it because we needed it.

This library isn't a theoretical exercise or a tool for hobby projects.  
We developed it to solve real-world problems we faced ourselves.  
Today, it powers authentication for [Onyxia](https://onyxia.sh),  
a data science platform deployed across multiple large organizations.
